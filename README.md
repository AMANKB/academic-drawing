Our examples
--------------

- **Download**
  - [mu10.mat](https://github.com/xinychen/academic-drawing/blob/master/curves/mu10.mat)
  - [mu_curve10.m](https://github.com/xinychen/academic-drawing/blob/master/curves/mu_curve10.m)

and evaluate these in Matlab in a folder, then, you will see the following picture:
